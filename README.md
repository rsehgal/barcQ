# barcQ
A repository to share ideas related to Quantum computing, and code to implement Quantum Algorithms

To launch the application to just view the frontend, open the **frontend/GridInterface/samples/gridSkeleton.html** file in the chrome browser

Here you can create the quantum circuit.

To see the complete thing in action, you need to install **CherryPy** webserver.

Once **CherryPy** is installed then run the **backend/cherryPyWork/pythonBackend.py** python file.
This will start the webserver at port 8000 of localhost, and now it can process the circuit using
the QuTiP in the backend.
